Introduction

This document will show the process of how the idea for the application was chosen, the multiple stages of design, and the methodology. The project shall be on a single page application which is designed to support students with their university experience.
Topic
To first start this assignment, it was essential to find out where students would like an improvement on their university experience. This required making a questionnaire and asking fellow students to fill it out. This will allow a better understanding of what students want improving and what to base the application design on.

Methodology

The next step was to pick a methodology to work along with the project. After looking through a selection the waterfall methodology was chosen . This methodology allows for requirements to be found, then designs to be made. These can then be verified by the public to see what needs changing. Once this is done the designs can be made into the application and any maintenance ca be done there after . https://www.projectmanager.com/waterfall-methodology 

Topic questionnaire

The question asked, ‘Whilst at university, what would you like to see to help improve your university experience?’ These were the results:

As the results show 44% of students would like an app which breaks down what the student hub and wellbeing hub can provide along with documents and process. Instant messenger came second with 24%, however this option seems illogical as most tutors/ lecturers will not be able to respond straight away. The other options were a timetable app and a deadline/exam timetable app but these are already features on the Solent App. Therefore, due to high demand and being the most logical topic. The application will be focused on student/ wellbeing hub breakdown and what they can offer.
